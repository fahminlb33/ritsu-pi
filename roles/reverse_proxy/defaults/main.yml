# Nginx Reverse Proxy
# Create subdomains to access your services. You need to install Pi-Hole and
# use the Pi-Hole as DNS server for all your clients.
#
# Note:
# To expose a service from within docker containers, you can use the service name
# as the hostname. You can also expose an IP address from your Pi.
reverse_proxy:
  # image to run
  image: nginx:alpine

  # config dir
  config_dir: "{{ config_dir }}/nginx"

  # extra subdomain to setup if you have more services to route
  subdomains:
    - subdomain: prometheus     # subdomain to access this service as http://{{subdomain}}.{{global_domain}}
      service: prometheus       # docker hostname or container name
      port: 9090                # published port in docker
      install: false            # set install to true to enable this routing

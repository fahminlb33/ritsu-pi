# Nginx Reverse Proxy
# Create subdomains to access your services. You need to install Pi-Hole and
# use the Pi-Hole as DNS server for all your clients.
#
# Note:
# To expose a service from within docker containers, you can use the service name
# as the hostname. You can also expose an IP address from your Pi.
